This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load ggplot and then load the diamonds data set that comes with ggplot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)

summary(diamonds)
diamonds$color
```
Make a histogram of the price of the diamonds data set
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=1:20000)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20000,100)
  

```
Now some summary statistics
mean is another term for average
median is the middle number in a sortedlist
```{r}
mean(diamonds$price)
median(diamonds$price)
```
The histogram is a long-tail variety.  The mean is much higher than the median.  So if a histogram is long-tail then the mean will be higher than the median??

What happens if the mean equals the median?

Now to look at the price and amount more closely
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price < 500)
summary(diamonds$price < 250)
summary(diamonds$price >= 15000)

```

now explore the largest peak in the histogram made earlier
might have to adjust the values to see it better
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,100)


qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,200)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1, ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250) 
                     
```
