This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load ggplot and then load the diamonds data set that comes with ggplot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)

summary(diamonds)
diamonds$color
```
Make a histogram of the price of the diamonds data set
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=1:20000)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20000,100)
  

```
Now some summary statistics
mean is another term for average
median is the middle number in a sortedlist
```{r}
mean(diamonds$price)
median(diamonds$price)
```
The histogram is a long-tail variety.  The mean is much higher than the median.  So if a histogram is long-tail then the mean will be higher than the median??

What happens if the mean equals the median?

Now to look at the price and amount more closely
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price < 500)
summary(diamonds$price < 250)
summary(diamonds$price >= 15000)

```

now explore the largest peak in the histogram made earlier
might have to adjust the values to see it better
```{r explore the largest peak}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,100)


qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,200)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250)

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1, ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250) 
                     
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1, ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250) 

```

Now break out the histogram of diamonds by cut.
I will create 5 histograms in seperate panels on the resulting plot.
```{r break out histogram using facet_wrap}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1, ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol=1)

by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, summary)
```
The shape of the broken out, or faceted histograms, looks very similiar to the original histogram.  But the first two histogramsa, the ones for fair and good look uniform, not long-tail

 Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
 Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
 the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
 be different for each histogram.
 
 Use free scales for clarification in histograms
 
```{r using free scale for y-axis}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1, ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000),
                     breaks=1:20000,250) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol=1, scales = "free")
```

```{r using log10 for the x-axis}
qplot(x = price/carat, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1 ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000),
                     breaks=1:20000,10) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol=2, scales = "free")

```
